# AA_emb

A simple Python toolkit for generating amino acid sequence embeddings
using pretrained protein language models.

---

## Overview

This repository provides scripts to extract **sequence-level embeddings**
from amino acid sequences using pretrained protein language models such as:

- Ankh (ankh-base, ankh3-xl)
- ESM2
- ProtT5

The generated embeddings can be used for downstream tasks including
translation efficiency prediction, protein property regression, and clustering.

---

## Features

- Supports multiple protein language models
- Mean pooling over residue-level embeddings
- Automatic handling of padding and special tokens
- GPU / CPU compatible

---

## Installation

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
